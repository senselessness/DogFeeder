Problem Statement:
I have two dogs, Pacer (the black one) and Tank (the white one). As you can tell, Pacer is overweight and I find it frustrating. I want her to live a healthier life and I am not home consistently anymore to walk her or mandate her diet. As a result, I need to come up with an effective way to control my dogs' diets. I am currently in the process of using SolidWorks to construct an effective mechatronic machine. This machine will feed the dogs when they get up around 0400 and it will feed them around 1600. Since my dogs are spoiled by my parents they get treats after dinner so the machine also needs to feed them a bone afterwards. Since there are two dogs and they get fed at the same time I need a way to determine which bowl belongs to which dog or the machine needs to mandate which dog gets the specified amount. I will also need to train them to be alerted when food will be served. I will most likely have a scale to determine how much each dog needs to eat. I need the feeder to have presets or be adjustable based on my dogs activity or current health. This can be manual, but maybe it will be automatic later. Basic mathmatic calculations will be done to determined how many calories the dogs will need to consume.

Physical prototypes will be posted on Thingiverse. The device will be mostly 3D printed, but later it may be made out of material so it can be easily replicated. If an easily replicated design is determined it will be posted on instructables.
